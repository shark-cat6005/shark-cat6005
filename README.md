# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **shark-cat6005**, a Minecraft Bedrock Edition script creator and web enthusiast. Here's a little more about me:

- I create **Minecraft Bedrock Add-ons** and work on **custom scripts** to improve gameplay.
  - I focus on creating better mods and maintaining popular ones I’ve made.
  - I love helping others who can't create mods by making things for them for free and becoming friends.
  
- **Traits:**
  - Introverted
  - Socially anxious
  - A cat
  - A shark
  
- I’m learning **web development**, but I have no background in it yet.
  - My current level: I rely on AI to create websites.
  
- I’m looking for help to create a website.  
  - **No paid help** accepted – I view it as advertising.
  
- Feel free to ask me about the **Minecraft Bedrock scripting API**.
  - My skills are average, and there's nothing special, so if you think you're super skilled, please don't ask.
  
- My Discord server: [Join Here](https://discord.gg/2fMyEjbkGQ)
  - I share my creations and updates there.
  - I don’t accept distribution requests.
  
- Pronouns: **She/Her**
  
- Fun fact: I **love Minecraft Bedrock Edition** and only play the Bedrock version!

- I’m not fluent in English, so I mostly use AI for translation.
  
- I use AI to help with programming, I don’t rely on AI.
  - Please don’t misunderstand me as someone who can only use AI and doesn’t know the basics. I’m just lazy, and when the problem is easy, I use AI. Of course, my skills are better than AI’s.
  
- にゃー

- I occasionally check GitHub.
